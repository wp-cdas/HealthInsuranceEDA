# Spring Semester, Session 2: Questions and Plans

This intent of this session is help answer any questions about data access, use of the DSP, methodology, and/or anything else that you need to help you get started with this semester's project-based curriculum.

The first question we will focus on is: How to plan rates vary across states?

Please come to this session having considered your approach for this analysis and armed with any questions you would need assistance with.

If you have a question before the session, please post it on the DSP Bulletin Board (https://bb.wpcdas.com).  When logging in to the Bulletin Board, use the "Alternative Login" button (the circular arrow thing), this should allow you to use your O365 login.

As a starting point, I would check out the "Data Dictionary" files located here: https://www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/data-resources/marketplace-puf

These files will help you understand the data files structure and what is available to you in this dataset.
